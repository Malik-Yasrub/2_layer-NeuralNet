# 2_layer-NeuralNet

                        *A first step to implementing gradient descent for a 2_layer neural network*
"Artificial neural networks or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains."

In this code i am using iris dataset from "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data".
